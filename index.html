<p class="title"> The objective was to digitally transform six images ans save them for web usage. To achieve this goal, I opted for affinity photo software due to its various and effective functionalities. All images 
have been downloaded from pexels.This page contains only manipulated images.To access the original images, I have created links under the manipulated imagers.</p>

<p> For this image I have removed unwanted objects


To modify this picture, I first of all used the auto contrast to adjust the image contrast.After that
   
I want to remove the bycicle and the piece of wood fixed in the wall.
I then  used the impainting brush tool to remove the bycicle and the piece of wood fixed in the wall.For a quick and easy removal I set the width of the brush to 130px.
Remove unwanted objects with the magical Inpainting Brush.I decided to use the impainting tool, because it is easy and practical to use.
To repair the errors after using the impainting brush, I used the healing brush from the tool panel.
After that,I saved the image for the web by clicking on file and export. I then changed the size of the photo. I saved the image as a JPEG since it is a high quality format.The size has been reduced
to 800*533.

<p>For the logo, I wanted something simple with the first letter of my lastname K,which I put in a circle and on a red background.To make this, I used
the donut tool which I dragged down to middle of the background.Then, I used the artistic tool to write the letter K that I inserted in the circle. I also added some effects 
such as outiline and 3D to make my logo more appealing. After that I saved it for web usage with the export tool.</p>
