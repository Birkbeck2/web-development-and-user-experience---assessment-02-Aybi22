<p class="title"> The objective was to digitally transform six images ans save them for web use. To achieve this goal, I opted for affinity photo software due to its various and effective functionalities. All images 
have been downloaded from pexels.This page contains only manipulated images.To access the original images, I have created links which I named original image.</p>

<h2>image1</h2>

<p> For this image I removed unwanted objects.
 First of all, I used the auto contrast to adjust the image contrast. After that,
 I used the impainting brush tool to remove the bycicle and the piece of wood fixed in the wall. For a quick and easy removal, I set the width of the brush to 130px.
To repair the errors after using the impainting brush, I used the healing brush from the tool panel.
Finally, I saved the image for the web by clicking on file and export. I then reduced the size  of the photo to 800*533 which I saved the as the best JPEG quality.

<p>To make sure to have a nice image I clicked on develop persona, then selected assistant manager and  applied a tone curve by sticking the take no action option.
 After that I made use of the basic tools to adjust the picture. To get access to the basic tools, I clicked on develop persona.
 I set the brightness to 25% to add light to the image and the backpoint to 4%. I also increased the contrast to 9%.
 To intensify the colours I defined the saturation to 20%. For the vibrance I opted for 15%. To improve details on the picture 
 I used the highlight tool to lower the brightness.
I reduced the dimensions to 500*750 and the quality to 70 and saved it for web use.

<p>For the logo, I wanted something simple with the first letter of my lastname K,which I put in a circle and on a red background.To make this, I used
the donut tool which I dragged down to middle of the background.Then, I used the artistic tool to write the letter K that I inserted in the circle. I also added some effects 
such as outiline and 3D to make my logo more appealing. After that I saved it for web usage with the export tool.</p>
